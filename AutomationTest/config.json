Whilst most charges are updated and form part of your account balance within 4-24 hours of the charges being incurred, there can be a delay in processing charges for the third party services such as international roaming, downloading data and applications and using premium services. The delay in processing international roaming charges can be up to 60 days. This means that the Usage and Overspend Alerts that you receive are as up to date as they can be based on our records at that time but may not contain all charges that you have actually accrued at that point.",
